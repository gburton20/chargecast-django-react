# chargecast-django-react
ChargeCast is a climate-aware fleet optimisation engine with Django + Supabase + React + Tailwind. It is a refactored product based on a prior version jointly built by myself, George Burton, and my co-contributor, Blae Quayle, as part of the Software x Climate September 2025 cohort programme.
